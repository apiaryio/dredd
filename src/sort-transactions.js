# Often, API description is arranged with a sequence of methods that lends
# itself to understanding by the human reading the documentation.
#
# However, the sequence of methods may not be appropriate for the machine
# reading the documentation in order to test the API.
#
# By sorting the transactions by their methods, it is possible to ensure that
# objects are created before they are read, updated, or deleted.
