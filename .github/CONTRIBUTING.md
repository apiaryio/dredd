# Contributing Guidelines

## Quick Start

### Ideas

- File an [issue][issues].
- Explain why you want the feature. How does it help you? What for do you want the feature?

### Bugs

- File an [issue][issues].
- Ideally, write a failing test and send it as a Pull Request.

### Coding

- Dredd is written in JavaScript [ES2015+](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/).
- Dredd uses [Semantic Release and Conventional Changelog](#sem-rel).

#### Recommended Workflow

1. Fork Dredd.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Write tests.
4. Write code.
5. Lint what you created: `npm run lint`
6. Send a Pull Request.
7. Make sure [test coverage][] didn't drop and all CI builds are passing.

#### Semantic Release and Conventional Changelog

Releasing of new Dredd versions to npm is automatically managed by [Semantic Release][].
Semantic Release makes sure correct version numbers get bumped according to the **meaning**
of your changes once your PR gets merged to `master`.

To make it work, it's necessary to follow [Conventional Changelog][]. That basically
means all commit messages in the project should follow a particular format:

```
<type>: <subject>
```

Where `<type>` is:

- `feat` - New functionality added
- `fix` - Broken functionality fixed
- `perf` - Performance improved
- `docs` - Documentation added/removed/improved/...
- `chore` - Package setup, CI setup, ...
- `refactor` - Changes in code, but no changes in behavior
- `test` - Tests added/removed/improved/...

In the rare cases when your changes break backwards compatibility, the message
must include string `BREAKING CHANGE:`. That will result in bumping the major version.

Seems hard?

- See [existing commits][] as a reference
- [Commitizen CLI][] can help you to create correct commit messages
- `npm run lint` validates format of your messages

## Handbook for Contributors and Maintainers

### Maintainers

[Apiary][] is the main author and maintainer of Dredd's [upstream repository][].
Currently responsible people are:

- [@netmilk](https://github.com/netmilk) - product decisions, feature requests
- [@honzajavorek](https://github.com/honzajavorek) - lead of development
- [@michalholasek](https://github.com/michalholasek) - team member

### Programming Language

Dredd is written in [JavaScript (ES2015+)][] and is meant
to be ran on server using Node.js. Before publishing to the npm registry, it is
compiled to plain ES5 JavaScript code (throwaway `lib` directory).

Tests need pre-compiled every time because some integration tests use code
linked from `lib`. This is certainly a flaw and it slows down day-to-day development,
but untill we streamline our build pipeline, the `lib` dependency is necessary.

Also mind that [CoffeeScript][] is production dependency (not dev dependency),
because it's needed for running user-provided hooks written in CoffeeScript.

### Compiled vs pure JavaScript

Dredd uses [Drafter][] for parsing [API Blueprint][] documents. Drafter is written in C++11 and needs to be compiled during installation. Because that can cause a lot of problems in some environments, there's also pure JavaScript version of the parser, [drafter.js][]. Drafter.js is fully equivalent, but it can have slower performance. Therefore there's [drafter-npm][] package, which tries to compile the C++11 version of the parser and uses the JavaScript equivalent in case of failure.

Dredd depends on the [drafter-npm][] package. That's the reason why you can see `node-gyp` errors and failures during the installation process, even though when it's done, Dredd seems to normally work and correctly parses API Blueprint documents.

#### Forcing the JavaScript version

The `--no-optional` option forces the JavaScript version of Drafter and avoids any compilation attempts when installing Dredd:

```sh
$ npm install -g dredd --no-optional
```

#### Troubleshooting the compilation

If you need the performance of the C++11 parser, but you are struggling to get it installed, it's usually because of the following problems:

- **Your machine is missing a C++11 compiler.** See how to fix this on [Windows][Windows C++11] or [Travis CI][Travis CI C++11].
- **npm was used with Python 3.** `node-gyp`, which performs the compilation, doesn't support Python 3. If your default Python is 3 (see `python --version`), [tell npm to use an older version][npm Python].

### Supported Node.js Versions

Given the [table with LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release), only versions marked as **Maintenance** or **Active** are supported, until their **Maintenance End**. The testing matrix of Dredd's CI builds must contain all currently supported versions and must not contain any unsupported versions. The same applies for the underlying libraries, such as [Dredd Transactions][] or [Gavel.js][].

In following files the latest supported Node.js version should be used:

- `appveyor.yml` - Windows CI builds
- `docs/install-node.sh` - ReadTheDocs docs builds

### Dependencies

New versions of dependencies are monitored by [David][] and/or [Greenkeeper][]. Security issues are monitored by [Snyk][].

Dependencies should not be specified in a loose way - only exact versions are allowed. Any changes to dependencies (version upgrades included) must be approved by Oracle before merged to `master`. Dredd maintainers take care of the approval. For transparency, PRs with pending dependency approval are labeled respectively.

The internal Oracle policies about dependencies pay attention mainly to licenses. Before adding a new dependency or upgrading an existing one try to [make sure](https://github.com/davglass/license-checker) the project and all its transitive dependencies feature standard permissive licenses, including correct copyright holders and license texts.

### Versioning

Dredd follows [Semantic Versioning][]. To ensure certain stability of Dredd installations (e.g. in CI builds), users can pin their version. They can also use release tags:

- `npm install dredd` - Installs the latest published version including experimental pre-release versions.
- `npm install dredd@stable` - Skips experimental pre-release versions.

When releasing, make sure you respect the tagging:

- To release pre-release, e.g. `42.1.0-pre.7`, use just `npm publish`.
- To release any other version, e.g. `42.1.0`, use `npm publish && npm dist-tag add dredd@42.1.0 stable`.

Releasing process for standard versions is currently automated by [Semantic Release][]. Releasing process for pre-releases is not automated and needs to be done manually, ideally from a special git branch.

### Testing

Use `npm test` to run all tests. Dredd uses [Mocha][] as a test framework.
It's default options are in the `test/mocha.opts` file.

### Windows

Dredd is tested on the [AppVeyor][], a Windows-based CI. There are still [several known limitations][windows issues] when using Dredd on Windows, but the intention is to support it without any compromises. Any help with fixing problems on Windows is greatly appreciated!

### Linting

Dredd uses [eslint][] to lint the JavaScript codebase. We are using [Airbnb's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
rules as a baseline with several rules disabled to allow us to have dirty
post-decaffeinate code temporarily.

Linter is optional for local development to make easy prototyping and work
with unpolished code, but it's enforced on CI level. It is recommended you
integrate [eslint][] with your favorite editor so you see violations
immediately during coding.

### Changelog

Changelog is in form of [GitHub Releases][]. Currently it's automatically
generated by [Semantic Release][]. See [above](#sem-rel) to learn
about how it works.

### Documentation

Dredd's documentation is written in [Markdown][] using [Sphinx][]. [ReadTheDocs][] is used to build and publish the documentation:

- [https://dredd.readthedocs.io](https://dredd.readthedocs.io) - preferred long URL
- [https://dredd.rtfd.io](https://dredd.rtfd.io) - preferred short URL

Source of the documentation can be found in the [docs][] directory. To render Dredd's documentation on your computer, you need Python 3 and Node.js installed.

#### Installation and Development

1.  Make sure `node` is an executable and `npm install` has been done for the Dredd directory. Extensions to the docs are written in Node.js and Sphinx needs to have a way to execute them.
2.  [Get Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On macOS, run `brew install python3`. [ReadTheDocs][] build the docs with Python 3.5, so make sure you have that or higher.
3.  Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activate it:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    . ./env/bin/activate
    ```

4.  Install dependencies for the docs: `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`

Once installed, you may use following commands:

- `npm run docs:build` - Builds the documentation
- `npm run docs:serve` - Runs live preview of the documentation on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

#### Installation on ReadTheDocs

The final documentation gets deployed on the [ReadTheDocs][]. The service, however, does not support Node.js. Therefore on ReadTheDocs, the `conf.py` configuration file for Sphinx runs `docs/install-node.sh`, which installs Node.js locally, using [nvm][].

#### ToC and Markdown

Traditionally, Sphinx only supported the [reStructuredText][] format. Thanks to the [recommonmark][] project it's possible to use also [Markdown][], _almost_ as a format native to Sphinx. Dredd's docs are using the [AutoStructify][] extension to be able to specify _toctree_ and other stuff specific to reStructuredText. The ToC is generated from the _Contents_ section in the `docs/index.md` file.

[AutoStructify]: https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_structify.html

#### Node.js Extensions

There are some extensions hooked into the build process of [Sphinx][], modifying how the documents are processed. They're written in Node.js, because:

- It's better to have them in the same language as Dredd.
- This way they're able to import source files (e.g. `src/options.coffee`).

<!-- To display the Hercule syntax, escaping is needed, because this document itself gets processed by Hercule. But escaping by backslashes doesn't work inside Markdown code blocks, so manual <code> element is added. -->

By default, [Hercule][] is attached as an extension, which means you can use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:\[Title](link.md)</span></code> syntax for including other Markdown files. All other extensions are custom and are automatically loaded from the `docs/_extensions` directory.

The extension is expected to be a `.js` or `.coffee` script file, which takes `docname` as an argument, reads the Markdown document from `stdin`, modifies it, and then prints it to `stdout`. When in need of templating, extensions are expected to use the bundled `ect` templating engine.

[Hercule]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hercule

#### Local References

Currently the [recommonmark][] project has still some limitations in how references to local files work. That's why Dredd's docs have a custom implementation, which also checks whether the destination exists and fails the build in case of broken link. You can use following syntax:

- `[Title](link.md)` to link to other documents
- `[Title](link.md#section)` to link to sections of other documents

Any `id` HTML attributes generated for headings or manual `<a name="section"></a>` anchors are considered as valid targets. While this feels very natural for a seasoned writer of Markdown, mind that it is much more error prone then [reStructuredText][]'s references.

#### Redirects

Redirects are documented in the `docs/redirects.yml` file. They need to be manually set in the [ReadTheDocs administration](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/dredd/redirects/). It's up to Dredd maintainers to keep the list in sync with reality.

You can use the [rtd-redirects](https://github.com/honzajavorek/rtd-redirects) tool to programmatically upload the redirects from `docs/redirects.yml` to ReadTheDocs admin interface.

#### Symlinked Contributing Docs

The `docs/contributing.md` file is a [symbolic link][] to the
`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file, where the actual content lives.
This is to be able to serve the same content also as
[GitHub contributing guidelines][] when someone opens a Pull Request.

### Coverage

Dredd strives for as much test coverage as possible. [Coveralls][] help us to
monitor how successful we are in achieving the goal. If a Pull Request
introduces drop in coverage, it won't be accepted unless the author or reviewer
provides a good reason why an exception should be made.

The Travis CI build uses following commands to deliver coverage reports:

- `npm run test:coverage` - Tests Dredd and creates the `./coverage/lcov.info` file
- `npm run coveralls` - Uploads the `./coverage/lcov.info` file to Coveralls

The first mentioned command goes like this:

1. [istanbul][] is used to instrument and cover the JavaScript code.
2. We run the tests on the instrumented code using Mocha with a special lcov reporter,
   which gives us information about which lines were executed in a standard lcov format.
3. Because some integration tests execute the `bin/dredd` script in
   a subprocess, we collect the coverage stats also in this file. The results
   are appended to a dedicated lcov file.
4. All lcov files are then merged into one using [lcov-result-merger][]
   and sent to Coveralls.

#### Notes

-  Hand-made combined Mocha reporter is used to achieve running tests and collecting
   coverage at the same time.
-  Both Dredd code and the combined reporter decide whether to collect coverage
   or not according to contents of the `COVERAGE_DIR` environment variable, which
   sets the directory for temporary LCOV files created during coverage collection.
   (If set, collecting takes place.)


### Hacking Apiary Reporter

If you want to build something on top of the Apiary Reporter, note that it uses a public API described in following documents:

- [Apiary Tests API for anonymous test reports][]
- [Apiary Tests API for authenticated test reports][]

Following data are sent over the wire to Apiary:

- [Apiary Reporter Test Data](data-structures.md#apiary-reporter-test-data)

There is also one environment variable you could find useful:

- `APIARY_API_URL='https://api.apiary.io'` - Allows to override host of the Apiary Tests API.

### Misc Tips

- When using long CLI options in tests or documentation, please always use the notation with `=`
  wherever possible. For example, use `--path=/dev/null`, not `--path /dev/null`.
  While both should work, the version with `=` feels
  more like standard GNU-style long options and it makes arrays of arguments for `spawn` more readable.
- Using `127.0.0.1` (in code, tests, documentation) is preferred over `localhost` (see [#586](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/586)).
- Prefer explicit `<br>` tags instead of [two spaces][md-two-spaces] at the end of the line when writing documentation in Markdown.
