Dredd â€” HTTP API Validation Tool
=================================

Dredd is a command-line tool for validating API documentation written in `API Blueprint`_ format against its backend implementation. With `Dredd`_ you can easily plug your API documentation into the Continous Integration system like `Travis CI`_ or `Jenkins`_ and have API documentation up-to-date, all the time. `Dredd`_ uses the `Gavel`_ for judging if a particular API response is valid or if it isn't. If you are curious about how decisions are made, please refer to Gavel's behavior specification.
